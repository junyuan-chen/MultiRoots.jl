[NonlinearSystems.jl](https://github.com/junyuan-chen/NonlinearSystems.jl)
is a Julia package for solving nonlinear systems of equations and nonlinear least squares.
It renovates well-trusted solution algorithms with
highly performant and extensible implementation in native Julia language.

NonlinearSystems.jl places special emphasis on

- Low number of evaluations needed for updating the Jacobian matrix
- Flexibility of swapping the underlying linear solver based on array type and hardware
- Zero memory allocation incurred in iteration steps

At this moment, the only solution algorithm implemented
is a modified version of Powell's hybrid method
(a trust region method with dogleg).
Relations to existing packages are further discussed towards the end.

## Quick Start

NonlinearSystems.jl adopts the
[CommonSolve.jl](https://github.com/SciML/CommonSolve.jl) interface
and wraps a residual function as `OnceDifferentiable` defined in
[NLSolversBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLSolversBase.jl)
with an optionally user-provided Jacobian function.
The same interface is shared for
solving a root-finding problems and solving a least-squares problems.

```julia
using NonlinearSystems

# Residual function
function f!(F, x)
    F[1] = (x[1] + 3) * (x[2]^3 - 7) + 18
    F[2] = sin(x[2] * exp(x[1]) - 1)
    return F
end

# Jacobian function (optional)
function j!(J, x)
    J[1,1] = x[2]^3 - 7
    J[1,2] = 3 * x[2]^2 * (x[1] + 3)
    u = exp(x[1]) * cos(x[2] * exp(x[1]) - 1)
    J[2,1] = x[2] * u
    J[2,2] = u
    return J
end

# Initial value
x0 = [0.1, 1.2]

# Evaluate Jacobians via finite differencing methods from FiniteDiff.jl
solve(Hybrid{RootFinding}, f!, x0)

# Use user-specified Jacobian function and separate out the initialization step
s = init(Hybrid{LeastSquares}, f!, j!, x0)
solve!(s)
```

NonlinearSystems.jl addresses the following limitations that the related packages do not:

- [MINPACK.jl](https://github.com/sglyon/MINPACK.jl) and [GSL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/GSL.jl)
  - No option for swapping the linear solver
  - Use of rank-1 update of the Jacobian matrix and factorization cannot be adjusted
  - Wrappers of C interface; no native Julia implementation
  - MINPACK.jl does not work on Apple Silicon
- [NLsolve.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl)
  - No option for swapping the linear solver
  - No rank-1 update of the Jacobian matrix and factorization
  - Iteration steps are not non-allocating
  - No support for nonlinear least squares
- [NonlinearSolve.jl](https://github.com/SciML/NonlinearSolve.jl)
  - No rank-1 update of the Jacobian matrix and factorization
  - Iteration steps are not non-allocating
  - No support for nonlinear least squares
- [LeastSquaresOptim.jl](https://github.com/matthieugomez/LeastSquaresOptim.jl)
  - Only solves nonlinear least squares
  - No rank-1 update of the Jacobian matrix and factorization
- [LsqFit.jl](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/LsqFit.jl)
  - Only solves nonlinear least squares
  - Performance seems to be dominated by LeastSquaresOptim.jl

## Roadmap

At this moment, only trust-region methods are considered and
the linear problem involved in each iteration is only solved by dense matrix factorization.
The package is intended to be lightweight.
